This folder includes all the data and code for the oil rate prediction using three machine learning methods (ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet).

The revision sub-folder has both code and production data for all 65 wells in the unconventional resources Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin.

All the code files are written in Google Colab. The csv files of production data for all wells are saved in the Google Drive for easy access. 

The publication is also included in this folder. Please consider citing this paper if needed
