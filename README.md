This folder includes all the data and code for the oil rate prediction using three machine learning methods (ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet).

The revision sub-folder has both code and production data for all 65 wells in the unconventional resources Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin.

All the code files are written in Google Colab. The production data is saved in my Google Drive for easy access.
